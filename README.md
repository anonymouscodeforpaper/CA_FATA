# Project Title
Implementation of Ca-FATA

## Description

In this paper we propose CA-FATA, context-aware features attribution through argumentation. Our framework harnesses the power
of argumentation by treating each feature as an argument that can either support, attack or neutralize a prediction. Additionally,
CA-FATA formulates feature attribution as an argumentation procedure, and each computation has explicit semantics, which makes
it inherently interpretable. CA-FATA also easily integrates side information, such as usersâ€™ contexts, resulting in more accurate
predictions.

## A toy example
![A graphical representation of an argumentation procedure in a recommendation scenario. Each node represents an argument, at represents a feature of an item, the central node represents an argument "This item can be recommended to the target user". The value on the arc denotes the strength and polarity of the argument, "+" denotes supports, "-" denotes attacks, and "0" denotes neutralizes. ](https://github.com/anonymouscodeforpaper/CA_FATA/blob/main/figures/toy.png)

## Installing

* How/where to download your program
* Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders

## Executing codes

* name controls the selection of dataset, n_epochs defines the number of epochs, dim is the dimension of embedding, l2_weight is the regularization rate, lr is the learning rate, context_or = True means that users' contexts are considered, average_or = True means that the importance of features is considered.

* On the Frappe dataset

```
python3 main.py --name 'Frappe' --e_epochs 100 --dim 256 --batch_size 256 --l2_weight 5e-5 --lr 5e-3 --context_or True --average_or True
```
*On the Yelp dataset
```
python3 main.py --name 'Yelp' --e_epochs 100 --dim 16 --batch_size 4096 --l2_weight 1e-3 --lr 5e-2 --context_or True --average_or True
```
