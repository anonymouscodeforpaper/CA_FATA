# Project Title
Implementation of Ca-FATA

## Description

In this paper we propose CA-FATA, context-aware features attribution through argumentation. Our framework harnesses the power
of argumentation by treating each feature as an argument that can either support, attack or neutralize a prediction. Additionally,
CA-FATA formulates feature attribution as an argumentation procedure, and each computation has explicit semantics, which makes
it inherently interpretable. CA-FATA also easily integrates side information, such as usersâ€™ contexts, resulting in more accurate
predictions.

## A toy example
![A graphical representation of an argumentation procedure in a recommendation scenario. Each node represents an argument, at represents a feature of an item, the central node represents an argument "This item can be recommended to the target user". The value on the arc denotes the strength and polarity of the argument, "+" denotes supports, "-" denotes attacks, and "0" denotes neutralizes. ](https://github.com/anonymouscodeforpaper/CA_FATA/blob/main/figures/toy.png)
